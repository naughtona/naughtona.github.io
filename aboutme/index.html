                        I stumbled upon the wonderful world of Computer Science in Semester 2 of 2018, when I was a second-year <a href="https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/undergraduate/bachelor-of-commerce/" target="_onblank">Bachelor of Commerce</a> undergraduate student at UoM and decided to take <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2020/subjects/comp10001" target="_onblank">Foundations of Computing</a> (COMP10001) as a breadth study.
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        At the time I was gearing up for a November start as a summer intern at KPMG's Melbourne Office. I did not expect this introductory course in computing to captivate me the way it did. I started having doubts about whether I should continue down this path towards a career in Accounting and Finance. So, I decided that I would undertake the sequel to COMP10001, entitled <a href="https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2020/subjects/comp10002" target="_onblank">Foundations of Algorithms</a> (COMP10002), trusting that on completion, I would be better informed about whether Computer Science was for me.
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        During the course of the semester, I was working part-time at KPMG as an undergraduate consultant and had also been offered a graduate role to start in February of the next year (2020). This did not make my choice any easier... 
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        COMP10002 developed my understanding and appreciation of algorithms and their design, as well as the amazing things you can do with a low-level, strongly-typed, imperative language such as C. It was an overwhelmingly positive experience and my choice by now was made clear.
                    </p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        At the end of 2019 I completed my Bachelor of Commerce at UoM, having majored in Finance and Accounting. I have since pursued my passion for programming and software development and not looked back.

                        I am currently midway through my <a href="https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/graduate/graduate-diploma-in-computer-science/" target="_onblank">Graduate Diploma in Computer Science</a> (GD-CS) at UoM.
